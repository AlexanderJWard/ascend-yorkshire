                <p>
                The Yorkshire Dales is situated in the northern region of the Pennines and contains some truly beautiful walks that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and walking abilities. The three main walks are on peaks Pen-y-ghent, Whernside & Ingleborough. Not prepared to tackle all three peaks in one go? Look to do a single peak, or part of one, at a more leisurely pace and just take in the fresh air, rolling hills and sounds of nature before heading back for a well-deserved coffee.
                </p>

                <h2 class="welcome-section-heading">Share the enjoyment</h2>
                <p>
                The three peaks are very popular so you can always find plenty of people who are willing to share their passion for hiking, either with new routes to take or advice on what essentials to bring. Whether you’re in the car park about to embark on your journey or on top of one of the peaks, take comfort in the fact you’re not alone in your outdoor adventure.

                Rome wasn’t built in a day. All the beauty can’t be explored in a single visit so why not stay the night before and after your walk? This allows you to wake up early and start your journey with the backdrop of a gorgeous sunrise. Keep exploring until it gets dark without having to worry about getting home after a full day of walking. There are plenty of hotels in nearby villages for either small or large groups.

                <p>
                Take the Three Peaks challenge and conquer this mammoth 26mile task of Pen-y-ghent, Whernside & Ingleborough all in one day. Make sure your fully prepared and expect a long day if you’re not one of the many fell runners who make it look easy. Staying the night before and after is highly recommended as the average completion time is around 8 - 12 hours.
