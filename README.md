For my title font I've chosen __Skranji__ as it looks very rugged and outdoorsy, fitting for the theme of my hiking website. Some of the letters look primative and can be pictured as part of a rock formation on a mountainside which I really think invokes the theme of Ascend Yorkshire. I'll mainly be using regular 400 but I've included bold 700 incase I decide to go with this instead.

My secondary font is __Tillana__ which I picked as it's in keeping with the theme of my title font and I think compliments it nicely. The edges aren't perfectly straight in places which makes it look rugged, this is why I think it's fitting with my title choice. I've chosen medium 500 as it's a nice balance between thick and thin, I've also picked bold 700 for any bold paragraph text that'll be needed throughout.
