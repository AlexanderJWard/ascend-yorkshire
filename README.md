### Project Goals

### Design Choices

#### Colors

I've picked earthy colors that work well together to match my Ascend Yorkshire theme due to it being a website focused on the outdoors. The main color is a nice dark olive green/brown which I'm using alongside a white with very light green tones. There's also a complimentary dark green background being used throughout for some sections. I've also picked a bright white and rich black to potentially use to replace potential low contrast issues if they arise. I've tested multiple combinations of my colors in a contrast accessibility website, https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/, to ensure my website is readable by people with visual impairment.

- #37371F - Olive Drab
- #F4FFF8 - Mint Cream
- #1F371F - Phthalo Green
- #F8F8F8 - Cultured (Possible contrast replacement)
- #0F1A20 - Rich Black (Possible contrast replacement)

#### Typography

For my title font I've chosen __Skranji__ as it looks very rugged and outdoorsy, fitting for the theme of my hiking website. Some of the letters look primative and can be pictured as part of a rock formation on a mountainside which I really think invokes the theme of Ascend Yorkshire. I'll mainly be using regular 400 but I've included bold 700 incase I decide to go with this instead.

My secondary font is __Tillana__ which I picked as it's in keeping with the theme of my title font and I think compliments it nicely. The edges aren't perfectly straight in places which makes it look rugged, this is why I think it's fitting with my title choice. I've chosen medium 500 as it's a nice balance between thick and thin, I've also picked bold 700 for any bold paragraph text that'll be needed throughout.
